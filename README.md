### 4
1.Created ProductItem component to show product image, name, and price.

3.Built LatestCollection to show the 10 newest products.
4.Built BestSeller to show top 5 best-selling products.
5.Used ShopContext to get product data and currency.
6.Used React Router (Link) to go to product details page.

### 5
- Created **OurPolicy** section with icons, headings, and descriptions for exchange, return, and support policies.
- Built **NewsletterBox** component with a subscription form that prevents page refresh and takes email input.
- Developed **Footer** with company info, contact details, and copyright text.
- Styled components: added font, colors, image sizes, text alignment, list styling, and spacing.

### 6
- Fixed mobile view sizes for OurPolicy.jsx, NewsletterBox.jsx, and Footer.jsx to look proper on small screens.
- Created a responsive Collection page in React.
- Learned how to use useState and useEffect to detect screen size (mobile or desktop).
- Implemented conditional rendering — filters are always visible on desktop, but toggle on mobile.
- Improved understanding of window resizing and event listeners in React.

1. I have  loaded all products from the ShopContext.
These products contain details like name, price, category, and subCategory.
2. I keep two arrays in state:
category → stores selected categories (Men, Women, Kids)
subCategory → stores selected types (Topwear, Bottomwear, Winterwear)
3. When a checkbox is clicked, you add or remove its value in the state.
If it’s already selected → remove it
If it’s not selected → add it
This works for both category and subCategory.
4. I have used a function applyFilter() that filters products.
It creates a copy of all products and then:
If any category is selected → keep only those category items
If any type is selected → keep only those type items
Finally, the filtered list is saved in filterProducts.
5. Whenever category or subCategory changes, the filter runs again.
This is done using useEffect(() => applyFilter(), [category, subCategory]).

### 8
Added mobile-responsive CSS using @media (max-width: 767px) for better layout on small screens.
Updated the SearchBar design to adjust spacing, padding, and icon sizes on mobile.
Removed large margins and made the search bar full-width on mobile devices.
Used !important to properly override desktop CSS styles on mobile.
Updated SearchBar.jsx to show the search bar only on the Collection page.
Used useLocation + useEffect to control when the SearchBar should be visible.
Made the search input fully responsive by fixing width, font size, and alignment issues.
